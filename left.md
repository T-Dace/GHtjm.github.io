I graduated from Aberystwyth University in 2021 with a degree in Mathematics, kick starting my professional career in a banking graduate scheme before pursuing a career in data science and landing my first         internship at a local agricultural business as a business analyst, learning key business principles while working directly with the company director, applying and developing my analytical skills.

I'm a life long student of Mathematics with keen interests in data driven solutions and scientific problem solving.
