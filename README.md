### Machine Learning Models for Detecting Credit Card Fraud
Credit Card Fraud is more prevalent in today's society than at any point in our digital history where over Â£551 million pounds was lost to credit, debit and payment card fraud in the UK last year alone. I built a Random Forest model, an XGBoost model, a Logistic Regression model, and developed a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network model using Python to explore and detect fraud.

### Retail Trends and KPIs PowerBI Dashboard

I created PowerBI dashboards, making use of DAX queries to identify key performance indicators for the retail sales dataset which I selected, picking out and visualising KPIs that were calculatable from the dataset used. As well as templating the dashboard to allow for easy replication for new data, with a variety of different templates and DAX queries for different KPI selections.

### Optimising Business Data with SQL Database Manipulation
I utilised SQL queries to transform large datasets, subsequently improving the speed of querying data using a large business based dataset by (Node processing time ranging from (114ms - 380 ms with 225 ms average processing time to 57ms - 211 ms at 114ms average processing time, as the results show). Demonstrating a keen understanding of SQL querying and optimisation.

### Fantasy Premier League Power BI Dashboard

I created an FPL dashboard using PowerBI, Using DAX queries to create KPIs for a strong FPL selection. I used PowerShell to connect to the FPL API, ran and cleaned the data through Excel before inputting it into Power BI and making clean interactive visualisations.
